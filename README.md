## Weather Dashboard

https://torihendricks927.github.io/HW-6-Weather-Outlook/

We created a weather dashboard that can be used to search the weather forecast of any city. Once searched, it will display the current day weather forcast including temperature, wind, humidity, IV index, and picture of expected weather. It will also show below the forecast over the next 5 days within the searched city. Once done searching the users city, the past city will be saved on left hand side to be clicked on if needed to be pulled up again.
